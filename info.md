*** Project Overview ***
Generate weekly meal plans based on recipes from a given list

*** Core Functionality ***
- Generate a weekly meal plan based on recipes from a given list
- Recipes should be selected from the list based on the user's dietary preferences and restrictions
- Users will be able to store their lists of recipes in a database
- Users can add to their recipe database by providing links to webpages containing recipes
- Users can specify the number of meals they want to have in a day

*** User Flow ***
First Login:
1. User creates an account
2. User selects the number of meals they want to have in a day 
3. User selects the number of days per week they want to have their meals planned
4. User selects the recipes they want to include in their meal plan
5. User clicks a button to generate the meal plan
6. User can click a button to save the meal plan to their recipe database

Subsequent Logins:
1. User logs into the application
2. User can click "add recipe" button to add a recipe to their recipe database
3. User's homepage displays this week's meal plan

*** Additional Requirements ***

1. CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete functions for recipes and meal plans
2. We'll use Heroku for deploying the backend and Netlify or Vercel for the frontend. GitHub will host your code repository

I am not a developer and I am creating my first web application. Your role throughout this conversation will be to help me deploy a functioning application that adheres to development best practices. I will rely on you to help explain tools, how to use them, connect them, and basically everything related to making my vision come to reality.

The first version of this web application will focus on generating a weekly meal plan from a database of recipes. Users will be able to add recipes their catalogue and we will have to store them in a database. Then, they will input the number of meals they want to plan per day and the number of days per week they would like planned. The app will take that information and create a weekly meal plan for them.

At some point in the future, I'd like this app to be able to do things like:
1. Identify available ingredients from pictures or videos of the user's pantry and make recommendations on recipes
2. Create shopping lists for the grocery store based on the meal plan
3. Make recommendations for the meal plan based on meals that haven't been made in a while
4. Take into account dietary goals, like consuming 150+g of protein in a day or eating a green vegetable at every meal

We still start small and simpler, but I am providing that information in the event it is useful when determining how the infrastructure of this application or the codebase will be built.

For some additional context, expect users to use this application in the browser. They will need to create an account (let's assume we will only allow authentication through a Google account to start - we can expand login/auth functionality later). Then, they will need to provide links to websites that have recipes they want to add to their collection. Then, they will be prompted to input the dimensions of their meal plan (days per week + meals per day). Finally, their meal plan will be generated. 

Note, the collection (database) of recipes will need to be stored and be able to be added to as well as be unique to the user that submitted them (one user cannot see another's recipes).

With all that context in mind, my first objective is to get an understanding for all the different "components" or files in the codebase we will have to create. Please detail how you expect we will need to set up the codebase. Please include key files and file types and the reasoning why we will need. Please also include important functions or logic that will need to be built.
